Description: To investigate how spatial proximity of cell types may influence 
    each other and shape the signaling landscape, we can Combine the spatial 
    cellular colocalizations with their enriched ligand-receptor co-expression 
    patterns inferred from both spatial and single-cell transcriptomic data to 
    illustrate the spatially resolved cell interaction.
    rctd4weights() function will help you tidy the confident weights for every 
    pixel after RCTD analysis. 
    cellColocation() function will help you get the co-localized cell type pairs.
    st_comm() function will help you get the significant cell-cell communication
    restricted by ligand-receptor co-expressed in co-localized cell type pairs.
